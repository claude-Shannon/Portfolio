# Portfolio: Shannon L. Sabino
Making websites is boring, but putting PDFs on Github is easy.

Shannon_Sabino_Embedded_Report.pdf is an etch-a-sketch type project, implemented in the logic fabric of a Xilinx Zynq chip on a Zybo board, with references to the included Embedded_Lab_4.pdf for the VGA controller. 

Shannon_Sabino_DSP_Report.pdf is a short, theory based report on the Short-Time Fourier Transform and my implementations of related functions in MATLAB.
